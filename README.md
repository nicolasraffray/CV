CV

I first came into contact with coding while on my masters after taking an introduction to machine learning module and a data analytics module. From making a few small scripts in Python and R I knew I wanted to pursue this further. It was then I discovered Makers where the emphasis on building and creating seemed like a great fit. 

Jumping into [Makers](insert_link) straight after a masters was challenging but fun. Makers both taught and reinforced sets of skills I thought were completely unrelated to coding, such as Agile workflow and effective pair programming. This helped me develop projects with others that I wouldn’t have thought were possible in the deadlines we were set, while applying sound coding practices. Learning through doing, building and creating at Makers has been a wonderful experience and I hope to continue as a Junior Developer. 



Skills

-	Leadership: While at university I was a captain the University of London polo team. Here I helped coach people who had never ridden a horse before to become proficient polo players, they began in October and by February they were national champions for their division. While on my masters I also lead a 3-month group project with people who hadn’t come from a finance background. Through dividing work according to strengths and tutoring we were able to achieve the 2nd highest grade in the year.

-	Team Player: In the AirBnB project I was able to adapt to the Agile style of workflow and our team was able to create a clone of AirBnB within a week. This was also the case for the Facebook clone created over two weeks where we worked iteratively, rotating leadership, to achieve the projects minimum viable product. 

-	Enthusiastic and Inquisitive: While on my masters, doing portfolio management, I noticed that balancing a portfolio could be done with some of the python skills taught in my data analytics module. So, I set about coding a python script to do the optimization and graphing. After being at makers and learning the good coding fundamentals I’ve been refactoring when I’m able to find time. I also learnt about neural networks in my machine learning module using R and am currently attempting to build one from scratch using only Python’s maths library NumPy. 

-	Adaptable and Quick Study: During my time at makers I’ve learnt to be able to synthesis large amounts of content or ideas and then put them to functional use. At Makers I had to learn JavaScript in a week and be able to apply it this can be seen in my thermostat challenge where I was also able to play around with jQuery. 

Projects & Code

Notes for me: think about splitting the table into personal projects and group projects or keep them in one but say if was in group setting or self proj.

Experience 

Volunteer Maths Tutor Action Tutoring (Summer Term – 2019) will find actual date dw 
Once a week I would tutor small groups of students that were struggling with maths. They didn’t like the material very much, so I made games based off the set material to make games they’d like to play but still meet the learning objectives. These were games like battleships and variations off snakes and ladders.

Brand Ambassador at Macacha fitness nutrition Start-up (Aug 2017- Aug 2018) 
Represented the brand at various stores and events selling product to a range of clients and collaborated with the owner to help the start-up grow. Responsible for organising events for up to 15 people and created content for social media.
