# CV

I first came into contact with coding while on my masters after taking an introduction to machine learning module and a data analytics module. Creating/developing scripts in Python and R whilst studying for my masters forged my drive to pursue coding further. Completing the Makers Academy training sharpened my skills and interest in building and creating code.


Jumping into [Makers](insert_link) straight after a masters was challenging but fun. Makers both taught and reinforced sets of skills I thought were completely unrelated to coding, such as Agile workflow and effective pair programming I developed projects as part of a team in time frames I would have otherwise thought unfeasible, all whilst applying precise coding practices.  Learning through doing, building and creating has been key to achieving an adept and practical knowledge of coding and programming. I hope to continue these practises as a Junior Developer. 


## Skills

-	Leadership: While at university I captained the University of London polo team. Here I helped coach people who had never ridden a horse before to become proficient polo players, they began in October and by February they were national champions for their division. I also lead a 3-month group project as part of my masters with people who hadn’t come from a finance background. Delegating work according to strengths and tutoring meant we were able to achieve the 2nd highest grade in the year.

-	Team Player: In the AirBnB project I adapted to the Agile style of workflow and our team was able to create a clone of AirBnB within a week. Similarly, engaged iteratively when creating a Facebook clone over two weeks, rotating leadership to achieve the projects minimum viable product. 

-	Enthusiastic and Inquisitive: While on my masters, doing portfolio management, I noticed that balancing a portfolio could be done with some of the python skills taught in my data analytics module. So, I set about coding a python script to do the optimization and graphing. After being at makers and learning the good coding fundamentals I’ve been refactoring when I’m able to find time. I also learnt about neural networks in my machine learning module using R and am currently attempting to build one from scratch using only Python’s maths library NumPy. 

-	Adaptable and Quick Study: I’m able to synthesis large amounts of content or ideas and then put them to functional use. At Makers I had to learn JavaScript in a week and be able to apply it this can be seen in my thermostat challenge where I was also able to play around with jQuery. 

## Projects & Code

Notes for me: think about splitting the table into personal projects and group projects or keep them in one but say if was in group setting or self proj. 

• AirBnB
• Acebook or something
• Pong

## Experience 

Volunteer Maths Tutor Action Tutoring (May 2019 – July 2019) 

Once a week I would tutor small groups of students that were struggling with maths. They didn’t like the material very much, so I made games based off the set material to make games they’d like to play but still meet the learning objectives. These were games like battleships and variations off snakes and ladders.
